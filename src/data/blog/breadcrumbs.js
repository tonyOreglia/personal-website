  BreadCrumbs is an implementation of next generation social networking which
  revolves around geography based interaction. BreadCrumbs allow users to create
  and find static location based data. In a full featured application, the data
  could be anything: from a message, image, or video to a virtual restaurant
  rating, augmented reality footage, or advertisement. The user need not be
  connected to any other user in the traditional sense of social networking. No
  friendships or network needed. The only connection needed is location;
  irrespective of time. To receive data, the user only needs to be in the same
  place the data was dropped. Thus the user stumbles upon past messages as they
  explore the real world.
